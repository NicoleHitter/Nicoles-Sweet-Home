### Features Left to Implement
The recipe page will be updated weekly with a new recipe that is designed to keep users' interest.

In time the site should allow the user to be able to make orders online and might increase the menu list.

## Typography and colour scheme
Colours have been specified in CSS by hexadecimal (or hex) values. The colours used are complementary colours.


The navigation bar and footer are cold green and the content is mostly pink, pink or red nuances. The text colour used is gold.


Green is meant to make the user think about fresh products and nature, then pink and gold to introduce him to the world of fairytales as if to say that despite being made with natural ingredients the products also look very good.


Font styles used are Aboreto, Abhaya Libre and Great Vibes. Most of the text is designed using Aboreto to keep the text classic. The area o the recipe - which allows inventiveness, is using Aboreto. Great Vibes is only used to replace the full logo "Nicoles Sweet Home" with the initials "NSH".
 
## Testing
From each page, you can navigate through the nav bar that includes: Home, Menu, Recipe and Sign Up, which when hovered over become underlined.

A similar aspect can be found on the footer on each page which could redirect you to Social Media Links, except for the fact that when hovered over they do not become underlined.

The landing page finds you with a welcome message and a text, then underneath it contact area, which when hovered over turns white and the map can be opened further and used for directions.
On the Menu page, you can view 6 types of cakes offered by the bakery with the title above them, when hovered over the title it changes colour.
The Sign-Up page comes with a signup form with 5 required inputs and one submit button which once submitted will take you to the confirmation page. also once hovered over the inputs they change colour from white to light pink.

Nicoles Sweet Home project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes. Changes had to be made in regards to the alignment of content from horizontally aligned to vertically aligned, feature found on the first-page Contact area, Menu images and Recipe text and image.
